This is the GitHub source code repository for ControLeo2.  ControLeo2 is an Arduino Leonardo controller with quad relay outputs used to control reflow ovens.

In this folder are:
1. README - this file
2. A "ControLeo2‚Äù folder.  This is an Arduino library and examples for ControLeo2

To install the ControLeo2 library, please refer to:

Reflow Wizard
=============
* 1.0  Initial public release. (21 October 2014)
* 1.1  Bug fixes (30 December 2014)
*      - Oven temperature might not reach configured maximum temperature
*      - Adjusted values so learning happens faster
*      - Other minor improvements
* 1.2  Improvements (6 January 2014)
*      - Take temperature readings every 0.125s and average them.  Fixes errors
*        generated by noise from convection fans
*      - Refined learning mode so learning should happen in fewer runs
*      - Improved loop duration timer to enhance timing
*      - Moved some strings from RAM to Flash (there is only 2.5Kb of RAM)
* 1.3  No user-facing changes (19 January 2013)
*      - Fixed compiler warnings for Arduino 1.5.8

Planned for next release (probably mid-February):
1. Servo support to open the opening of the oven door
   Support for slow, high-torque servos (like the MG945) to open the door when the reflow is done, and close it again at 50C.
   The servo will be connected using 5V, GND and D3.  A larger 5V power supply *may* be needed.
